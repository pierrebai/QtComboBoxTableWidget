1. You need Visual Studio 2019. I used the community edition version.
2. You need to install the Qt5 SDK. You need to install the 64-bit SDK as the solution is 64-bit.
3. You need to set an environment variable pointing to the Qt5 SDK. The name is QT5_DIR. For example, I set mine to: C:\Tools\Qt5\5.15.0\
4. Use the Create-Solution.cmd script to create the Visual Studio solution.
5. Open the generated solution and build. It will copy the necesary Qt5 DLL in the output folder so the program can run.
